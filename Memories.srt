3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,500
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,600 
Of everything we've been through

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,000

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,300
There's a time that I remember when I did not know no pain

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,900
When I believed in forever

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,500
And everything would stay the same

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,200
Now my heart feel like December

14
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,800
When somebody say your name

15
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,600
'Cause I can't reach out to call you

16
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,900
But I know I will one day

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,400
Everybody hurts sometimes, everybody hurts someday

18
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,400
Everything will be alright, go on raise a glass and say

There's a time that I remember when I never felt so lost

32
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:48,300
When I felt that all the hatred was too powerful to stop

33
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,800
Now my heart feel like an ember

34
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,600
And its lighting up the dark

35
